We can implement `double` as follows:
```scheme
(define (double f)
  (lambda (x) (f (f x))))
```

In mathematical notation, we have $\mathrm{double}(f) = f âˆ˜ f = f^2$.
Therefore,
$$
  (\mathrm{double}(\mathrm{double}))(f)
  =
  \mathrm{double}^2(f)
  =
  \mathrm{double}(f^2)
  =
  (f^2)^2
  =
  f^4 \,.
$$
Consequently,
$$
  (\mathrm{double}(\mathrm{double}(\mathrm{double}))(f)
  =
  (\mathrm{double}(\mathrm{double}))^2(f)
  =
  (\mathrm{double}(\mathrm{double}))(f^4)
  =
  (f^4)^4
  =
  f^{16} \,.
$$

We see that `((double (double double)) inc)` should be a procedure that increases its input by $16$.
The value of `(((double (double double)) inc) 5)` should therefore be `21`.

We can verify this result with `mit-scheme`:
```text
1 ]=> (((double (double double)) inc) 5)

;Value: 21
```
