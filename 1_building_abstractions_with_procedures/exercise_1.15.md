### a.

We have the following evaluations:
```scheme
(sine 12.15)

(p (sine 4.05))

(p (p (sine 1.35)))

(p (p (p (sine 0.45))))

(p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))

(p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05))))))

(p (p (p (p (p 0.05)))))

⋮
```
We see that the procedure `p` is applied five times when evaluating `(sine 12.15)`.



### b.

Each iteration takes a constant amount of space and time.
Both orders of growth are therefore $Θ(n)$ where $n$ is the number of times that we need to divide $a$ by $3$ to reach a value that is smaller than $0.1$ in terms of absolute value.
The number $n$ is (roughly) $\log_3 |a| + 3$.
The required space for evaluating `(sine x)` is therefore in $Θ(\log |a|)$.
